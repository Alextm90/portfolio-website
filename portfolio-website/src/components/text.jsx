  descriptionOne: `A MERN stack app that handles issue management with CRUD operations and is deployed with Docker. I implemented an authentication system using access and refresh tokens, with Axios interceptors to keep users logged in and secure the appâ€™s routes. The refresh tokens are used to manage sessions securely, ensuring that authenticated users maintain access without having to log in repeatedly. The backend is tested with Mocha, Chai, and Axios for user registration and issue management.`,
  descriptionTwo: `A terminal-based number guessing game allows players to guess a random number between 1 and 1,000. The number of games played and the best score are stored and retrieved from a PostgreSQL database. Each session is tailored based on the player's history, creating a unique experience. The game is managed through a Bash script that interacts with the database to track and update player progress.`,
  descriptionThree: `This is a Pomodoro timer built with React. The timer features customizable session and break lengths, and transitions automatically between work and break intervals. It also includes audio alerts to signal the start and end of each session or break. The primary purpose of this project was to learn React and state management.`,
